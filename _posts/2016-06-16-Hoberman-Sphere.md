##Hoberman Expandable Sphere
<br>
Hoberman Associates Inc. have created several interactive structures. The best known are the expandable spheres that folded up, they look like stars, all angles and ridges and points. Pull on any pair of points, though, and the star blooms into a sphere with nearly double its original diameter.
Hoberman says that the design for his best known creation came about through a process of discovery and transformation. “I wanted to know if I could use the principles of mechanisms to make forms that transform themselves, in other words, the whole function of the mechanism is to transform itself, by itself.” 
You can see some of his work in the pictures bellow:
