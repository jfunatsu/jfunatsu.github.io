#### What is Architecture?

In fact, the term Architecture is very complex, embracing and difficult to be described. Many historicists and theorists tried to explain architecture through their point of view.
For the ancient Greek culture, architecture was all about beauty through proportion, module and the Golden number.
Vitruvius Pollio (c. 90 - c. 20 BCE), a Roman engineer and architect, who wrote De architectura (on architecture) defined architecture as the union of three concepts: firmitas, utilitas and Venustas, which means firmness, commodity and delight.
For Le Corbusier, a very important architect from the international style, architecture should have five aspects: pilotis, free plan, free facade, long windows and roof garden.
For me, architecture is the study and realization of space and its relationship with the environment and people. It changes with the society that it is designed for. Nowadays the society is becoming completely technological and so is architecture.

#### What is a Robot?

According to Galileo website, a Robot is a system that contains sensors, control systems, manipulators, power supplies and software all working together to perform a task. It has four essential characteristics: sensing, movement, energy and intelligence. In other words, the robot needs to perceive the surrounding through sensors like light, touch and pressure, chemical or sonar sensors. The robot also needs to move, be able to power itself and be “smart”. The smart of one robot can be acquired with a programming.

#### How could a robot be architectural?

Robots can have many functions in different fields of study, one of these fields is architecture. A robot that is architectural is programed to help the fabrication in architecture. It can move bricks and construct a wall, for example.

#### How could architecture be robotic?

Day by day buildings are getting more technological and intelligent. Everywhere you can see doors that open with movement sensors, stairs that moves, lights that turn on by themselves. All those elements collaborate to architecture to be a robot. 
One great example is the Institut du Monde Arabe, in Paris, France, designed by Jean Nouvel. A main feature and innovative element of the building is the advanced responsive metallic brise soleil on the south facade. The system incorporates several hundred light sensitive diaphragms that regulate the amount of light that is allowed to enter the building. During the various phases of the lens, a shifting geometric pattern is formed and showcased as both light and void. Squares, circles, and octagonal shapes are produced in a fluid motion as light is modulated in parallel. Interior spaces are dramatically modified, along with the exterior appearance.
