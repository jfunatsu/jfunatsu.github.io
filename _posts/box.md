## Laser Cut Box

After modeling patterns using the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhinoceros, which I showed in this post [here](http://jfunatsu.github.io/grasshopper-box/), I made a box with those patterns using a laser cutter machine. The result can be conferred in the pictures below:

There are two types of cuts in the laser cutter: the vector and the raster. I tried both techniques and I had very different results.
The cut made in vector mode made stronger lines, but it took about one hour and half to engrave two sides of the box. It took long because the raster mode engraved line by line of the complex drawing. Despites of the time it took the result was successful.

The cut with raster mode was much faster and it is the recommended one to make engraving like the patterns used, with many lines and details. The machine took about twenty minutes to engrave four sides of the box. The lines got a little light compared to the rasterized ones.
