Architecture is not only about the building and its structural components like walls, doors and windows. Architecture is also about the empty space between those components creates and how it is occupied. Furniture is an important complement of architecture, it defines how the space will be organized and used. One way that furniture can influence the architecture is being interactive through robots.
