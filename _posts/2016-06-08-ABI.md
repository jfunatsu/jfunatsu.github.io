The Adaptive Building Initiative is, according to Hoberman website, a joint venture between Buro Happold and Hoberman Associates dedicated to designing a new generation of buildings that optimize their configuration in real time by responding to environmental changes.
Hoberman Associates is one of the best-known contemporary performance-based adaptive shading systems in collaboration with New York Office of Buro Happold, a global design and engineering firm. They allied in 2008 and created the Adaptive Building Initiative.
One of their projects is the Simons Center, located in Stony Brook, NY. In Hoberman’s website, they describe the project: “serving as both the building's artistic centerpiece and as a functional piece of shading, the installation is a floor-to-ceiling composition of Adaptive Building Initiative's Tessellate™ panels. Hoberman designed each panel to have a unique geometric pattern of perforations that mirrors the research focus of the building's resident scientists and mathematicians. As these patterns align and diverge, the visual effect is of sparse geometric patterns — hexagons, circles, squares, and triangles — that blossom into an opaque mesh. The result is a kinetic surface that spans 38 square meters and imbues the building with the functional capacity to dynamically change its opacity and sculpt the quality of light within.
A second, complementary installation, an artistic steel gate, was created for an adjoining art gallery. After gallery hours, the gate’s static perforated steel panels create an undulating field of curved, intersecting lines. By day, these panels cleanly fold together to create a three-dimensional sculpture within the gallery. Parametrically generated by the planar slicing of a twisted cubic form, the stacked form creates twisting, open volumes — a play on positive and negative space — with dynamic sight lines that change as visitors walk around it.”

Another impressive project is The Dome located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Hoberman's design included a large operable oculus, similar to the Iris Dome, as well as a series of panels that can vary their permeability by utilizing the Permea™ system from Hoberman venture Adaptive Building Initiative. The The system performs environmentally both to control light levels and air flows in the space.
